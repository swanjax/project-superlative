_Always make those above you feel comfortably superior.
In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite — **Inspire fear and insecurity**. 
Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power._
## Transgression of the Law (p. 2)
[Nicolas Fouquet](/project-superlative/Notable%20Figures/Nicolas%20Fouquet.md) served as [Louis XIV's](/project-superlative/Notable%20Figures/Louis%20XIV.md) finance minister during the early years of the monarch's reign. He was known for his extravagant lifestyle. He was clever and indispensable to the king.

When the prime minister died in 1661, Nicolas Fouquet was expected to be the successor.
However the kind decided to abolish the position of the prime minister all together.
This and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favour.
Hence, Fouquet decided to ingratiate himself with the king by staging the most spectacular party the world had ever seen.
The party’s ostensible purpose was to commemorate the completion of Fouquet’s château, Vaux-le-Vicomte. In reality, it was to pay tribute to the guest of honour, the monarch.
Many notable figures were present and there was even a performance Molière’s play.
Everyone agreed that this was the most amazing affair they had ever attended.

The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king’s head musketeer.
A few months later he went on trial for stealing from the countries treasury
- Most of the stealing he had done was in fact, done _on behalf_ of the king and _with_ the king’s permission
Was found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the Pyrenees Mountains
Spent last 20 of his years in solitary confinement.

### Interpretation (p. 2)
Louis XIV, the Sun King, could not countenance being out-done in lavishness by anyone, especially not Fouquet.
To succeed, take the place of, Fouquet, the king chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert, renowned for his parsimony and for hosting the dullest parties in France.
Colbert made sure that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into the king’s hands.
With the money, Louis XIV built an even more magnificent palace that the Vaux-le-Vicomte — The glorious Versailles.
He held parties more extravagant than the one that costed Fouquet his freedom.

_Examining the situation_
Fouquet presented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each one more magnificent than the one before.
He believed that this would show his good taste, connections and popularity.
→ Making him indispensable to the king
→ Would make an excellent prime minister

However, each new spectacle and appreciative smile bestowed upon Fouquet, made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more charmed by the finance minister than by the king himself.

Rather than flattering Louis XIV, Fouquet’s elaborate party offended the king’s vanity. Louis would no admit this — Instead he found a convenient excuse to rid himself of the man who had made him feel insecure.

Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the master’s sense of self, pole holes in his vanity, or make him doubt his pre-eminence.

>_When the evening began, Fouquet was at the top of the world._
>_By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom._
>**~ Voltaire, 1694 - 1778**
